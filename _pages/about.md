The idea for the Last Call Project coalesced in May of 2017.  I had graduated from my degree program two years prior and, upon ruminating about my experiences during this often tumultuous, scary, and wonderful time, realized in retrospect that by sharing my pitfalls and successes I might be able to help others who were either thinking about making the journey I made or were in some stage of actively doing so.  As I had conversations with some of my service industry friends that were undertaking similiar journeys to mine but had not yet graduated and were still in school, I realized that I could help them by sharing things I had learned (oftentimes the hard way) that they had yet to encounter.

Through other contact with friends who wanted to escape the industry but were daunted and discouraged by the difficulty of doing so (a sentiment I knew all too well), I began to realize there were many others who were also in some phase of what I had gone through.  Thus, the idea slowly germinated to provide some kind of portal or aid for those curious about effecting this kind of change for themselves.  In addition to my own story, I thought it would be useful to have stories of some of my friends that had gone through their own versions of what I had.  As there is no one path to do this, the greater the number of different perspectives and possibilities presented the larger available pool there is from which one can synthesize their own course of action.

The idea behind each of the posts is for each author to be as honest as possible.
