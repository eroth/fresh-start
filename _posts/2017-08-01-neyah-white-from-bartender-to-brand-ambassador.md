I didn’t want to step out from behind the bar, to be honest. Cocktails were very good to me. The traditional immediate rewards of fun nights, getting paid mostly in cash and not having to take my work home with me were bolstered by the incredible camaraderie of the cocktail community, the opportunities to travel and be a part of the greater drinks industry and the creative outlet that managing bars gave me.

I was as happy and fulfilled as I have ever been.

The issue came in the form of an ankle injury that refused to heal. I was overweight, developing high blood pressure and could barely walk on Sunday mornings. I just couldn’t do the time on my feet any longer. The next best step, I thought, would to be a brand ambassador, a marketing position that is sort of bartender adjacent. I applied all over and interviewed with a full dozen brands but there was always a disconnect. Start-ups without the money to pay me, brands with no actual business plan, products I didn’t believe in and companies I didn’t trust. After a year I was close to giving up and starting to look at going back to school for an MBA when I got a call from a Japanese brand I didn’t know much about. I did a little research on them and their story looked fascinating so I pushed to interview.

Well, it was great. I will say that my idea then of what spirits marketing is was pretty naïve compared with my point of view now. But they were a great group that led me along a path of growth and I am still dear friends with a lot of that team.

I work for other brands now and have had about as good of a career in this role as anyone gets. When I get asked for advice on how to get into something like this, I don't talk about resumes and contacts at all. Best thing I did for myself was to be picky and not take something that wasn’t right just because I wanted a change. I make crap decisions when I’m rushed or scared and I think most other people tend to do the same. So, I made my move while I was happy and content. The bills were paid and I was secure so I could focus on the future while looking for a new position without worrying about the immediate. For me, this is the only way to make career decisions.
