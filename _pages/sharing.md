Thanks so much for your interest in writing a post for the Last Call Project! Here’s some more info that you may find helpful while you're going over ideas or figuring out how to put your experiences into words.  As the site is meant to be a resource for bartenders and service industry people that are thinking of getting out of the industry or are actively trying to, or that are interested in elevating themselves within the industry, think of your post as the info you wish you had known about ahead of time before you made the decision to do either, but instead had to learn the hard way! Think back to that time and the process/transformation you underwent, and write the note that you wish you could’ve received from your future self that would’ve made everything easier.  The note that would’ve saved you time banging your head against the wall or that would’ve prevented you from making the mistakes you made along the way—whether that’s around going back to school, starting a business, stopping drinking, fitness, becoming a brand ambassador, liquor rep, bar/restaurant owner, or anything else.

But your post should be more than that: think of it as something philanthropic to help others that are at the very beginning or somewhere along in the process of the same journey you undertook.  Below are just some rough ideas of things that could be written about for those on either journey, but there are no rules or guidelines.  Whatever it was, communicate that.  This project isn’t just about the steps from A-Z that you took; it’s also about people identifying with you and your story, because those people are going to be feeling something resembling what you were feeling then.  And they're going to be thankful they can learn from your experiences and know that they're not alone.

### For those that have left or are interested in doing so
Think back to how you felt then: Maybe it was frustration at how hard it could be to get out of the industry.  Maybe it was fear because you didn’t have any other skills, training, or experience to get another job with.  Maybe most of your social network was other bartenders and no one else understood where you were at.  Maybe you were worried about not making the lucrative and easy income that bartenders make.  Maybe you thought you'd miss the flexible schedule and were worried about being trapped behind a desk or answering to other people.

### For those that have advanced themselves within the industry or are interested in doing so
Talk about the passion you feel about the service industry and the craft.  Talk about the risks you've taken: Maybe you invested all the money you had saved to start your own bar and were petrified about what would happen if it didn't work out.  Maybe you took the leap from bartender to brand ambassador and were wondering if you'd miss life behind the stick.  Maybe whatever you tried didn't work out and you had to look for another gig.  

There aren’t really any guidelines to writing a post, except that you should feel free to write as much as you want.  More is better than less.  Don’t hold back the blood, sweat, and tears! Also, you’re encouraged to include pictures, links, videos, whatever you want.  The site doesn’t have an online tool where you can add your post online, but if you do it in a Word document you can include anything you want and I can put it together—you’ll also be able to check it out before it goes live to see if it looks ok.  Or you can submit it as a text document and include any pictures as attachments, and tell me where they should go.  Please send it to [evan@thelastcallproject.com](mailto:evan@thelastcallproject.com).

Finally, **please** promote yourself and what you’re doing now! Not only will it help you, but it will also help to inspire people as to what the possibilities are.  Also, if you have any other ideas or improvements for the site please let me know!

Thank you so much for contributing and congratulations on all your hard work!
